# Hi, I’m Patrick │ Ontology & Healthcare Data Engineer

I work at the intersection of semantic technologies and healthcare data systems, 
specializing in RDF/OWL modeling, SHACL validation, SPARQL diagnostics, and 
interoperability pipelines involving HL7 v2, FHIR, ICD-10, SNOMED CT, and LOINC.

My recent projects include: \
• An HL7→FHIR transformation and validation toolkit with RDF/OWL + SHACL  
• A semantic quality-checking framework using SPARQL and Python  
• Machine-learning pipelines for ECG classification (PyTorch)  
• Clinical data analytics projects using Python, SQL, and explainability tools (SHAP)

I hold a Ph.D. in Philosophy (Syracuse University) and a Master of Information Technology 
from Virginia Tech (Big Data & Health IT certificates), with a focus on structuring, 
validating, and integrating complex healthcare data.
